# WordSearchSolver
A program for finding all possible words in a word search constructed from a given string.

# Running this program
To run this program you need java JDK 1.8 or higher. It can be most easily run using a java IDE. I personally like to use intelij and if you want to go that route there is a free community edition here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
Once that is installed if you already have this repo cloned you can create a new project by going to File->New->Project from Existing Sources. If not then go to File->New->From Version Control and paste in the clone link from the repository.
Once you have a project setup open up WordSearchSolver.java and click the green run button text to the class name. If you want to change out the puzzle being searched it can be replaced in this file. The program takes a string of characters and converts it into a square word search based on the length of that string after whitespace characters have been removed.
